# GZDoomVanillaConfig
Its a config file that makes GZDoom look and play like vanilla.
Obviously, still limited by the capabilities of the engine. It's still going to be GZDoom, but very vanilla-like GZDoom.

To install, drop this next to the GZDoom exe.
Warning, this will take priority over your own config if you have one already set up.
In that case, i suggest you open both this config file and your own, and compare the differences, and adjust mine to your liking with your changes.
Notepad++ has a nice compare plugin that would probably make this easier

To uninstall, just delete it.

Oh, and if you didnt know, if you name the config file `gzdoom_portable.ini` and you put it next to the exe, you can use a portable installation of GZDoom, no documents folder shenanigans required.
